# data-anonymization-quality

## Purpose
This repo contains the script files used to investigate data anonymization quality metrics. Using Twitter data, user classifiers are trained to predict tweet authorship. These classifiers also serve as a tool to measure the level of privacy protection.

## Abstract
As big data becomes more prominent and the amount of data---whether voluntarily provided or inferred from other datasets---available on any given individual grows, privacy becomes an increasingly greater concern. As a result, research into machine learning as it relates to data anonymization is also becoming more important. The goal of this study is to survey machine learning data anonymization studies to date. Specifically, we investigate how data anonymization is evaluated, and what makes an anonymization good, in terms of levels of utility retained and privacy obtained.
