# data-anonymization-quality

## Purpose
This repo contains the script files used to investigate data anonymization quality metrics. Using Twitter data, user classifiers are trained to predict tweet authorship. These classifiers also serve as a tool to measure the level of privacy protection.

## Abstract
As  big  data  becomes  more  prominent  and  the  amount  of  data—whethervoluntarily  provided  or  inferred  from  other  datasets—available  on  any  givenindividual  grows,  privacy  becomes  an  increasingly  greater  concern.   As  a  re-sult, research into machine learning as it relates to data anonymization is alsobecoming more important.  The goal of this study is to survey machine learn-ing data anonymization studies to date.  Specifically, we investigate how dataanonymization is evaluated, and what makes an anonymization good, in termsof levels of utility retained and privacy obtained.
